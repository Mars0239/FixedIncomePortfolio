# Fixed Income Portfolio Analysis

## Overview

This project is a pure backend Python application designed to perform various fixed income portfolio analyses. It enables users to model and analyze different aspects of fixed income investments, including interest rate modeling, credit risk, yield to maturity (YTM), discounted cash flow (DCF), and portfolio optimization. The goal of this project is to provide users, especially those with a focus on finance and investment, with a comprehensive toolset for assessing and optimizing fixed income portfolios.

## Features

- **Interest Rate Modeling**: Simulate future interest rates using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model.
- **Credit Risk Modeling**: Estimate the default probability of a firm using the Merton model.
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: Calculate the total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until its maturity date.
- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**: Estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows, adjusted for the time value of money.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Optimize asset allocation in a portfolio to maximize expected returns for a given level of risk using Markowitz Portfolio Theory.
